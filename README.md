# Pyber_Analysis

## Module 5 Pyber Ride Share Analysis

### Overview of project
For the company PyBer create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Python and Panda skils I have also created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally included is a written analysis of my findings to help PyBer make informed decisions. 

##### Deliverables
  1. Ride-Sharing summary DataFrame by city type
  2. Multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
  3. Written Report for the PyBer analysis
