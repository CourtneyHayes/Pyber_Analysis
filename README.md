# Pyber_Analysis

## Module 5 Pyber Ride Share Analysis

### Overview of project
For the company PyBer create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Python and Panda skils I have also created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally included is a written analysis of my findings to help PyBer make informed decisions. 

##### Deliverables
  1. Ride-Sharing summary DataFrame by city type
  2. Multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
  3. Written Report for the PyBer analysis
  
  
  ### Conclusion
 Using what we have learned there are many more possibilities to analyze this data.
 Creating dataframes and the particular syntax used we were able to determine the following:
  
   -There are more than double the amount of rides and drives in Urban city types as opposed to        Rural and Suburban.
   
   -Because of item one, you will also see that the average fare per driver is significantly less
   in Urban than Rural or Suburban. 
   
   -The average fare per ride is relatively close in all city types.
   
   -Total fares are significantly higher in Urban Areas.
