# Pyber_Analysis

## Module 5 Pyber Ride Share Analysis

### Overview of project
For the company PyBer create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Python and Panda skils I have also created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally included is a written analysis of my findings to help PyBer make informed decisions. 

##### Deliverables
  1. Ride-Sharing summary DataFrame by city type
  2. Multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
  3. Written Report for the PyBer analysis


#### Process
- To create Ride-Sharing summary DataFrame by city type usuing both groupby() and sum() function to get the final result of each city type with their total amount of fares.
- To create a mupltiple line chart for the first deliverables data, using Pandas and the pivot() and resample() to create the line graph. 
- Written report (ReadMe) analysis for Pyber
  
  
  ### Conclusion
 Using what we have learned there are many more possibilities to analyze this data. However, more analysis can be done with the data given using the functions learned    here. 
 Creating dataframes and the particular syntax used we were able to determine the following:
  
   -There are more than double the amount of rides and drivers in Urban city types as opposed to Rural and Suburban.
   
   -Because of item one, you will also see that the average fare per driver is significantly less
   in Urban than Rural or Suburban. 
   
   -The average fare per ride is relatively close in all city types.
   
   -Total fares are significantly higher in Urban Areas.
